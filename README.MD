# Introduction
Welcome to KMeans-Algorithm, a Python-based implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm. K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used to group data points into k clusters based on their similarity. This repository provides a simple yet powerful class, KMeans, allowing users to efficiently perform clustering tasks on datasets of any size.

This implementation is designed with flexibility and ease of use in mind. Whether you're a beginner exploring machine learning concepts or a seasoned data scientist working on real-world applications, this project offers an intuitive way to perform clustering. It is suitable for tasks such as customer segmentation, image compression, and anomaly detection.

This repository also serves as a learning tool, showcasing the inner workings of the K-Means algorithm, including initialization, iterative optimization, and convergence handling. Contributions are encouraged to enhance its functionality and expand its use cases.


# Getting Started
To use the KMeans class, simply open a Jupyter Notebook and write the code inside it. You can interactively test and experiment with the algorithm, visualize your results, and adjust parameters as needed.

# Tested Dataset
The KMeans class has been tested using the well-known Iris dataset (in CSV format). This dataset contains data on different flower species, with features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. You can easily apply the class to this dataset or your own data for clustering analysis.
